## Companyâ€™s background

AltiQ Hardware is a company that has grown vastly in recent years, and opened business all over the globe. It is a company that sells, computers and computer accessories through three mediums/channel

- Retailer
- Direct
- Wholesaler/ Distributor

Recently the company has faced an unforeseen loss by opening a store in America based on surveys, intuition, and some Excel analysis also the companyâ€™s competitors has a handful of analytics team to perform analysis and make data-driven decision. So, the AltiQ hardware has no other option other than building its analytics team for data-driven insights and decisions in the future to survive better in the industry. 

Project kick-off session, where you should get clear of what and why this project is and all other questions you have with regards to the project

### Questions to ask before starting with the dashboard

- What is the objective of building this Power BI dashboard?
- In what terms the success of this project will be measured?
- What will be the deadline of the project?
- do the stakeholders expect a preview before the actual release?
- What are all the hopes stakeholders have out of this project?
- what are all the fears the stakeholders have in terms of building this dashboard?
- Who will be using this dashboard and for what purpose?
- what are all expectations the stakeholders have, by the completion of this project?
- What can go wrong while building this project?
- what are all the resources/ data needed to build this dashboard?
- is there any input from stakeholders in terms of design and views of the dashboard?

After the project kick-off meetings, the data engineering team has given the data as per the request of the data analytics team, letâ€™s explore them.

### Dataset Understanding

Data Cleaning and Data Exploration is the most crucial part of any data analysis project.

Dimension table: It is a database table that stores attributes that describe the facts in a fact table such as details of customers and products.

Fact table: The fact table contains business facts (or measures) such as data about transactions within a particular period. 

## Importing data into Power BI

- For this project, our data is stored in the MySQL database. To import the data from MySQL to Power BI we need to have the Database Access Credentials, select the server, and transform and load the data.

## Data Model

- Data modeling plays a key role and acts as a foundation for our report. All the visuals will be built upon the data model.
- Data models should be properly checked before moving on to the next step as mistakes would cause delays in project execution and stakeholders' dissatisfaction.
- Things to look out for while building a data model, refer to this page to get to know the good practices [Blog](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices/)
- In this project, we have used the snowflake data model.

### Designing an Effective Dashboard

Based on the mock-ups received from our stakeholders, the data analyst's job is to design and build dashboards.

## Project Insights

- Target data is a benchmark set by experienced management personnel and in this project, it is available for the year 2022 only and it gives a more accurate picture compared to the YoY change comparison. For this project, we have target data available for key metrics such as net sales, gross margin, and net profit with respect to their market/ country.

- In comparison with Last year,
for the year 2022, net sales changed by +353.5%, gross margin changed by +373%, gross margin % changed by +4.37%, and net profit % changed by -110.8%.

- In comparison with Target,
for the year 2022, net sales changed -1.86%, gross margin changed -2.51%, gross margin % changed -0.66% and net profit % changed +1.47%

- Hence, we must consider comparison with respect to target data for our analysis.

#### Key Metrics:

For the year 2022,
In comparison with Target,
- Net sales drop is highest (-2.48%) in the APAC region and comparatively better (-1.13%) in the EU region.
- Gross margin drop is highest (-3.8%) in the NA region and comparatively better (-1.72%) in the EU region.
- Gross margin % drop is highest (-2.59%) in the NA region and comparatively better (0.56%) in the APAC region.
- Net Profit drop is highest (-3.3%) in the EU region and comparatively better (-0.36%) in the APAC region.

#### Sales view and Marketing view:
-- Customer Performance:

For the year 2022,
In comparison with Target,
- GM % variance is 10% or higher, for customers such as Novus, Billa, Digimarket, Flawless Stores, Notebillig, and Otto.
- Net sales and gross margin generated by "Amazon" are the highest (497 Million â‚¹ & 182.77 Million â‚¹) among all customers and "Nova" generated the lowest net sales and gross margin (1.71 Million â‚¹ & 0.52 Million â‚¹) at the same time period.
- GM % is highest (48.55%) for "Relief" customers and it is lowest for "Novus" (21.5%).
- Net profit and net profit margin % generated by the APAC region are the lowest (-281.16 Million â‚¹ & -14.62%) among all regions and the LATAM region generated comparatively better net profit and net profit margin % (-0.44 Million â‚¹ & -2.95%) in the same time period.

-- Product Performance:

For the year 2022,
In comparison with Target,
- Net sales and gross margin generated by the segment "Notebook" is the highest (1580 Million â‚¹ & 600 Million â‚¹) among all segments and the "Networking" segment generated the lowest net sales and gross margin (38.4 Million â‚¹ & 14.8 Million â‚¹) in the same time period.
- The net profit and net profit margin % generated by the segment "Notebook" is the lowest (-222.16 Million â‚¹ & -14%) among all segments and the "Networking" segment generated comparatively better net profit and net profit margin % (-5.27 Million â‚¹ & -13.72%) in the same time period.

- AtliQ Hardware is in its expansion phase. Hence, a negative growth of net Profit and net profit % may not be the right metric to look at while analyzing its business growth as its main focus now is to gain a sizable amount of market share from its competitors and net sales and gross margin growth.

- Overall out of total gross sales, almost 50% accounts for deductions, and the rest 50% is net sales.
- Out of these net sales, 38% is Total COGS and the rest 62% is gross margin.
- Although the overall gross margin is +1,422 Million â‚¹ the operating expenses are on the higher side i.e., -1945 Million â‚¹ which together makes an overall negative net profit of -522 Million â‚¹.

#### Supply Chain view:

For the year 2022,
- Overall forecast accuracy % increased marginally by +1.2%, net error decreased by -362%, and absolute error decreased by -29.4% compared to last year.
- In the case of "Forward Stores", forecast accuracy % decreased from 50.7% to 10.7% in a year which resulted in Net Error % of -71.1%. Hence, they were not been able to cater to the high demand and went out of sold.
- In the case of "BestBuy", forecast accuracy % increased from 35.3% to 46.6% in a year which resulted in a Net Error % of 16.72. Hence, they were in excess of inventory.
- In the case of "Notebillig", forecast accuracy % increased from 18.8% to 42.7% in a year which resulted in a Net Error % of 1.31%. Hence, they were in excess of inventory. And, in the case of "Relief" stores, the forecast accuracy % is unchanged at around 52% for a year which results in a Net Error % of -0.14%. Hence, they were in an out-of-sell situation.
- A product segment called "Peripherals" which accounts for net error% (-32%) in a year results in making this segment out of sold. And, in a product segment called "Desktop" accounts for net error% (10.24%) in a year resulting in making this segment in excess of inventory.
